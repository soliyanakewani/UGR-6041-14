    <p>This is me. Anyone who knows me knows how i am opssesed with taking pictures. capturing the moment on my phone make sme happier. even if it is my profession, i still dont see it as work but my freedom. looking back at the photos i took makes me realise it is just a matter of being seen and an angle to be seen that will make things more beautiful.  </p>
    <p>in addition to photography, poetry is also my all time favorite hobby. i take what the world gave me through pictures and i show the world my insides through my poems. ever since i was little i have diffculty expressing my emotions on the moment of action but after was a beautiful moment of me communicating through my pens with the papers and not real people. and that was how i developed my skill of poetry. i have morethan 100 poems lying one on top of the other in my drawer waiting to be  told to the world who made contribution for their creastion. </p>
